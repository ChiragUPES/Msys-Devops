PEP8-> basically style guide for python
Python3 has some features which are not available in py2.br
for debugging we can add break points. So for adding a break points we can just simply click over it. And we can also add conditions to the break by simply
right click on it and add conditions.

for (condition):
  if:
    /////
    break
else:    
  else statement will execute only if the loop terminates normally. if it break than else will not executed.
Summary:
1) indentation is used for identfying which line ofcode belongs to which group.
2) if else sttement for condition
3) for loop: in range-> used when we know in advance how many time it will execute.
4) while loop are generlly used when we dont know exactly how many times loop will execute.
5) continue and break to interruput the normal flow of execution.
6) different use of else keyword as shown just above the summary.
