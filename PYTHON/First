Python version-> python --version
PIP install
SDK(Software Development Kit)-> tools we need to write a program
                                in py sdk, we have interprter that understand py code and execute it.
                                we also have a debugger 
                                it also includes standard libraray
We are using intellij-idea. 
VCS(Version Control System)-> If we want to fetch the project from git so we can easily fetch them.
What is py? 1) Py is object-oriented, interpreted language that's easy to use
            2) Runs on many operating systems including mac,linux,windows.
            3) Py supports basic data types such as numbers and strings , as well as more complex types like lists and dictionary that can be great simplify 
               data-processing.
print('Hello,World!')
print()-> 1) print is the function in py.
          2) which takes the things which we want to print in paranthesis.
          3) Here we have passed a strig literals (A string literals is the sequence of characters)
          4) It works out the result of our arithmetic expression
LITERAL-> value of some type. Example 1,2 or about tring literals it is "Hello! World"
Function-> A name of block of code that we can call, by using its name. 
           Example -> print is a built in function. 
           In py, all function return a value.
Agrument-> Value which is passed as an parameter with the function.
return value-> value that a function return.

String -> + sign is used for concatination. 
          How to take name as an input and display it? using input function which takes the value as an input and return value to an variable.
            iname=input('Please enter name')
            print("Dear"+" "+iname)

Backslash character-> \n-> to start new line
                      \t-> to give the tab space
                      print('This\n is \n fun');
                      # if we want to print the path
                      print(C:\Users\tmkin\notes.txt)-> it will take \u,\t,\n . So to avoid we can use double backslash or r in the front.
                      print('C:\\Users\\tmkin\\notes.txt')
                      print(r'C:\Users\tmkin\notes.txt')

Operator Precedence: Multiplication and divison have same precedence
                     Addition and substraction is of same precedence
indexing -> OUTPUT->  parrot='PAqROT'
            print(parrot[3])
            o/p-> R
Negative indexing-> -1 means that we have to count the index from the end of the string.
                    we can obtain the index by substracting it with the length of the string.

Slice: Last index not included.                     
      parrot="Norwegian Blue"
      print(parrot[0:6])
